# Context:
Over 2,000 employers in the United States of America were surveyed and have reported challenges securing needed human resources. A 2018 survey by ManpowerGroup found that 46% of US companies report having challenges filling or backfilling positions within their businesses. Considering the talent competition, this challenge is not strange. As part of the recruitment process, businesses with positions to fill see the challenges manifest in searching, identifying and attracting suitable talents locally and abroad. This challenge has been even compounded in the aftermath of the COVID-19 virus. Many talents now have demands that were nonexistent pre-COVID.

The Office of Foreign Labor Certification is responsible for labour certifications, attestation applications, and processing prevailing wages under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). Through the OFLC, the US Department of Labour administers various Foreign Labour Certification programs, among which is ensuring US employers comply with statutory requirements and providing guidance for processing applications through published directives and advisories.

To this end, the OFLC processes job certification applications for employers seeking to bring foreign workers into the United States and grants certifications in those cases where employers can demonstrate that there are not sufficient US workers available, able, willing and sufficiently skilled to perform the work at wages that meet or exceed the wage paid for the occupation in the area of intended employment.

# Objective:
In Q1 of FY 2022 alone, the OFLC processed over 120,300 applications for different businesses looking to fill over 220,000 temporary and permanent labour certifications, while in Q2 of FY 2022, a total of 151,603 applications were processed for 305,548 positions. This amounts to a 26% increase in applications. It is, therefore, evident that an efficient and faster approach to reviewing applications is necessary.

EasyVisa recommends a faster and more efficient approach that allows officials to focus on less repetitive or tedious tasks, such as a machine learning solution. Based on the data provided, a machine learning model will be built to identify and classify applications with higher chances of VISA approval.

The machine learning classification model will:

- Make visa approvals processing faster.
- Recommend a suitable profile for the applicants for whom the visa should be certified or denied based on the drivers that significantly influence the case status.
